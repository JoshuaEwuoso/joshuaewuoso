### Hi there ðŸ‘‹


Full Stack Web Development Fellow at Pursuit; an intensive 12-month Software Engineering fellowship with a 9% acceptance rate. I plan to utilize my practices here to create a new wave of diversity within the tech industry with skills such as JavaScript, CSS and pair programming.

My time away from programming is used for hobbies like archery, watching anime and cycling.

If you want to know more about me, send me a message or reach out to me at joe.omosanya@icloud.com
